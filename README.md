# My Express App

This is a boilerplate for building Express applications using Clean Architecture. The project structure is designed to make it easy to develop, maintain, and scale your application by organizing the code into logical components.

## 1. Directory Structure

The project is structured as follows:

``` console
my-express-app/
│
├── src/
│   ├── config/            # Contains application configurations, such as database connections and environment variables
│   ├── controllers/       # Contains controllers related to routes and HTTP requests/responses
│   ├── domain/            # Contains the core logic and entities of the application (e.g., business logic, models)
│   ├── use_cases/         # Contains logic for implementing specific features (use cases)
│   ├── repositories/      # Contains data access abstractions for accessing databases or other external data sources
│   ├── services/          # Contains code related to external services, such as sending emails, payment processing, etc.
│   ├── middleware/        # Contains middleware, such as authentication, authorization, and error handling
│   ├── helpers/           # Contains various helper functions and utilities
│   └── app.js             # The main entry point of the application
│
├── tests/
│   ├── controllers/       # Controller tests
│   ├── domain/            # Domain logic tests
│   ├── use_cases/         # Use case tests
│   ├── repositories/      # Data access logic tests
│   └── services/          # Service tests
│
├── .env                   # File for storing environment variables
├── .gitignore             # Git ignore rules
├── package.json           # Contains project dependencies and metadata
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```
